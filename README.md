# ModelToMinecraft
 A quick and dirty Unity app for getting 3D models into Minecraft.
 The 3D model has to be an OBJ file shouldn't be too complex.
 
 Output is a datapack containing one function:<br/>
 `/function modeltominecraft/buildmodel`<br/>
 When this function is called in Minecraft the model is built.

This app is using [Mesh-Voxelization](https://github.com/Scrawk/Mesh-Voxelization) by Scrawk and [UnityStandaloneFileBrowser](https://github.com/gkngkc/UnityStandaloneFileBrowser) by gkngkc.
